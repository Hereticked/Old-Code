/* 


The Most Important Differences:

    * XHTML elements must be properly nested
    * XHTML elements must always be closed
    * XHTML elements must be in lowercase
    * XHTML documents must have one root element




Some More XHTML Syntax Rules

    * Attribute names must be in lower case
    * Attribute values must be quoted
    * Attribute minimization is forbidden
    * The XHTML DTD defines mandatory elements


Here is a list of the minimized attributes in HTML and how they should be written in XHTML:
HTML 	        XHTML 
compact 	compact="compact"
checked 	checked="checked"
declare 	declare="declare"
readonly 	readonly="readonly"
disabled 	disabled="disabled"
selected 	selected="selected"
defer 	        defer="defer"
ismap 	        ismap="ismap"
nohref 	        nohref="nohref"
noshade 	noshade="noshade"
nowrap 	        nowrap="nowrap"
multiple 	multiple="multiple"
noresize 	noresize="noresize" 



The Lang Attribute

The lang attribute applies to almost every XHTML element. It specifies the language of the content within an element.

If you use the lang attribute in an element, you must also add the xml:lang attribute, like this:

<div lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ciao bella!</div>
