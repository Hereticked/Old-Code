Document Type Definitions (DTD)

    * A DTD specifies the syntax of a web page in SGML
    * DTDs are used by SGML applications, such as HTML, to specify rules for documents of a particular type, including a set of elements and entity declarations
    * An XHTML DTD describes in precise, computer-readable language, the allowed syntax of XHTML markup

There are three XHTML DTDs:

    * STRICT
    * TRANSITIONAL
    * FRAMESET


XHTML 1.0 Strict
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

Use the strict DOCTYPE when you want really clean markup, free of presentational clutter. Use it together with CSS. The Strict DTD includes elements and attributes that have not been deprecated or do not appear in framesets.


XHTML 1.0 Transitional
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Use the transitional DOCTYPE when you want to still use HTML's presentational features. The Transitional DTD includes everything in the strict DTD plus deprecated elements and attributes.


XHTML 1.0 Frameset
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd">

Use the frameset DOCTYPE when you want to use HTML frames. The Frameset DTD includes everything in the transitional DTD plus frames as well.
