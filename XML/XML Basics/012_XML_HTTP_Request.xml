/* The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes.

The XMLHttpRequest object is a developer's dream, because you can:

    * Update a web page without reloading the page
    * Request data from a server after the page has loaded
    * Receive data from a server after the page has loaded
    * Send data to a server in the background


All modern browsers (IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera) have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object.

Syntax for creating an XMLHttpRequest object:
xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();

Old versions of Internet Explorer (IE5 and IE6) uses an ActiveX Object:
xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); */
