/* Displaying XML with XSLT

XSLT is the recommended style sheet language of XML.

XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is far more sophisticated than CSS.

XSLT can be used to transform XML into HTML, before it is displayed by a browser.


Different browsers may produce different result when transforming XML with XSLT. To reduce this problem the XSLT transformation can be done on the server. */
