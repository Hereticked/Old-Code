Boolean Data Type

The boolean data type is used to specify a true or false value.

The following is an example of a boolean declaration in a schema:
<xs:attribute name="disabled" type="xs:boolean"/>

An element in your document might look like this:
<prize disabled="true">999</prize>

Note: Legal values for boolean are true, false, 1 (which indicates true), and 0 (which indicates false).
Binary Data Types

Binary data types are used to express binary-formatted data.

We have two binary data types:

    * base64Binary (Base64-encoded binary data)
    * hexBinary (hexadecimal-encoded binary data)

The following is an example of a hexBinary declaration in a schema:
<xs:element name="blobsrc" type="xs:hexBinary"/>

AnyURI Data Type

The anyURI data type is used to specify a URI.

The following is an example of an anyURI declaration in a schema:
<xs:attribute name="src" type="xs:anyURI"/>

An element in your document might look like this:
<pic src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/smiley.gif" />

Note: If a URI has spaces, replace them with %20.

Restrictions on Miscellaneous Data Types

Restrictions that can be used with the other data types:

    * enumeration (a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint)
    * length (a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint)
    * maxLength (a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint)
    * minLength (a Boolean data type cannot use this constraint)
    * pattern
    * whiteSpace
