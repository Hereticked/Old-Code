/*  Simple elements cannot have attributes. If an element has attributes, it is considered to be of a complex type. But the attribute itself is always declared as a simple type.

How to Define an Attribute?


The syntax for defining an attribute is:
<xs:attribute name="xxx" type="yyy"/>


Here is an XML element with an attribute:
<lastname lang="EN">Smith</lastname>

And here is the corresponding attribute definition:
<xs:attribute name="lang" type="xs:string"/>



Attributes may have a default value OR a fixed value specified.


A default value is automatically assigned to the attribute when no other value is specified.

In the following example the default value is "EN":
<xs:attribute name="lang" type="xs:string" default="EN"/>

A fixed value is also automatically assigned to the attribute, and you cannot specify another value.

In the following example the fixed value is "EN":
<xs:attribute name="lang" type="xs:string" fixed="EN"/>



Optional and Required Attributes

Attributes are optional by default. To specify that the attribute is required, use the "use" attribute:
<xs:attribute name="lang" type="xs:string" use="required"/>   */
