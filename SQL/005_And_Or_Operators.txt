The AND & OR Operators

The AND operator displays a record if both the first condition and the second condition is true.

The OR operator displays a record if either the first condition or the second condition is true.
AND Operator Example

The "Persons" table:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger

Now we want to select only the persons with the first name equal to "Tove" AND the last name equal to "Svendson":

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE FirstName='Tove'
AND LastName='Svendson'

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes

OR Operator Example

Now we want to select only the persons with the first name equal to "Tove" OR the first name equal to "Ola":

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE FirstName='Tove'
OR FirstName='Ola'

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes

Combining AND & OR

You can also combine AND and OR (use parenthesis to form complex expressions).

Now we want to select only the persons with the last name equal to "Svendson" AND the first name equal to "Tove" OR to "Ola":

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE
LastName='Svendson'
AND (FirstName='Tove' OR FirstName='Ola')

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
