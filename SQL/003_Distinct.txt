The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement

In a table, some of the columns may contain duplicate values. This is not a problem, however, sometimes you will want to list only the different (distinct) values in a table.

The DISTINCT keyword can be used to return only distinct (different) values.
SQL SELECT DISTINCT Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column_name(s)
FROM table_name

SELECT DISTINCT Example

The "Persons" table:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger

Now we want to select only the distinct values from the column named "City" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Persons

The result-set will look like this:
City
Sandnes
Stavanger
