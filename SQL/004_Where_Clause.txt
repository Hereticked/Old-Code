The WHERE Clause 

The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion.
SQL WHERE Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value

WHERE Clause Example

The "Persons" table:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger

Now we want to select only the persons living in the city "Sandnes" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE City='Sandnes'

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes

Quotes Around Text Fields

SQL uses single quotes around text values (most database systems will also accept double quotes).

Although, numeric values should not be enclosed in quotes.

For text values:
This is correct:

SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE FirstName='Tove'

This is wrong:

SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE FirstName=Tove

For numeric values:
This is correct:

SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Year=1965

This is wrong:

SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Year='1965'

Operators Allowed in the WHERE Clause

With the WHERE clause, the following operators can be used:
Operator 	Description
= 	Equal
<> 	Not equal
> 	Greater than
< 	Less than
>= 	Greater than or equal
<= 	Less than or equal
BETWEEN 	Between an inclusive range
LIKE 	Search for a pattern
IN 	If you know the exact value you want to return for at least one of the columns

Note: In some versions of SQL the <> operator may be written as !=
