The ORDER BY Keyword

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set by a specified column.

The ORDER BY keyword sort the records in ascending order by default.

If you want to sort the records in a descending order, you can use the DESC keyword.
SQL ORDER BY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name(s) ASC|DESC

ORDER BY Example

The "Persons" table:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger
4 	Nilsen 	Tom 	Vingvn 23 	Stavanger

Now we want to select all the persons from the table above, however, we want to sort the persons by their last name.

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Persons
ORDER BY LastName

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
4 	Nilsen 	Tom 	Vingvn 23 	Stavanger
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes

ORDER BY DESC Example

Now we want to select all the persons from the table above, however, we want to sort the persons descending by their last name.

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Persons
ORDER BY LastName DESC

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger
4 	Nilsen 	Tom 	Vingvn 23 	Stavanger
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
