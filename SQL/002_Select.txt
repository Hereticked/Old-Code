The SQL SELECT Statement

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The result is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
SQL SELECT Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name

and
SELECT * FROM table_name

Note Note: SQL is not case sensitive. SELECT is the same as select.
An SQL SELECT Example

The "Persons" table:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger

Now we want to select the content of the columns named "LastName" and "FirstName" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT LastName,FirstName FROM Persons

The result-set will look like this:
LastName 	FirstName
Hansen 	Ola
Svendson 	Tove
Pettersen 	Kari

SELECT * Example

Now we want to select all the columns from the "Persons" table.

We use the following SELECT statement: 
SELECT * FROM Persons

Tip: The asterisk (*) is a quick way of selecting all columns!

The result-set will look like this:
P_Id 	LastName 	FirstName 	Address 	City
1 	Hansen 	Ola 	Timoteivn 10 	Sandnes
2 	Svendson 	Tove 	Borgvn 23 	Sandnes
3 	Pettersen 	Kari 	Storgt 20 	Stavanger
