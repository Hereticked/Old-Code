    Question 1: The program Problem.java doesn't compile. What do you need to do to make it compile? Why?


public class Problem {
	String s;
	static class Inner {
		void testMethod() {
		   s = "Set from Inner";
		}
	}
}



    Answer 1: Delete static in front of the declaration of the Inner class. A static inner class does not have access to the instance fields of the outer class.
