       1. Consider the following code snippet:

              arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1]

          Question: What operators does the code contain?
          Answer: >, +

       2. Consider the following code snippet:

              int i = 10;
              int n = i++%5;

             1. Question: What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
                Answer: i is 11, and n is 0.

             2. Question: What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?
                Answer: i is 11, and n is 1.

       3. Question: To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use?
          Answer: The logical complement operator "!".

       4. Question: Which operator is used to compare two values, = or == ?
          Answer: The == operator is used for comparison, and = is used for assignment.

       5. Question: Explain the following code sample: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;
          Answer: This code should be read as: "If someCondition is true, assign the value of value1 to result. Otherwise, assign the value of value2 to result."
