    Question 1: Use the API documentation to find the answers to the following questions:

        Question 1a: What Integer method can you use to convert an int into a string that expresses the number in hexadecimal? For example, what method converts the integer 65 into the string "41"?
        Answer 1a: toHexString

        Question 1b: What Integer method would you use to convert a string expressed in base 5 into the equivalent int? For example, how would you convert the string "230" into the integer value 65? Show the code you would use to accomplish this task.
        Answer 1b: valueOf. Here's how:

            String base5String = "230";
            int result = Integer.valueOf(base5String, 5);

        Question 1c: What Double method can you use to detect whether a floating-point number has the special value Not a Number (NaN)?
        Answer 1c: isNaN 

    Question 2: What is the value of the following expression, and why?

        Integer.valueOf(1).equals(Long.valueOf(1))

    Answer 2: False. The two objects (the Integer and the Long) have different types.


/*

You use one of the wrapper classes -- Byte, Double, Float, Integer, Long, or Short -- to wrap a number of primitive type in an object. The Java compiler automatically wraps (boxes) primitives for you when necessary and unboxes them, again when necessary.

The Number classes include constants and useful class methods. The MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE constants contain the smallest and largest values that can be contained by an object of that type. The byteValue, shortValue, and similar methods convert one numeric type to another. The valueOf method converts a string to a number, and the toString method converts a number to a string.

To format a string containing numbers for output, you can use the printf() or format() methods in the PrintStream class. Alternatively, you can use the NumberFormat class to customize numerical formats using patterns.

The Math class contains a variety of class methods for performing mathematical functions, including exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric methods. Math also includes basic arithmetic functions, such as absolute value and rounding, and a method, random(), for generating random numbers.
