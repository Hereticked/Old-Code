       1. Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values.

       2. Expressions are the core components of statements.

       3. Statements may be grouped into blocks.

       4. The following code snippet is an example of a compound expression.

               1 * 2 * 3

       5. Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages, but instead of ending with a period, a statement ends with a semicolon.

       6. A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed. 



    Identify the following kinds of expression statements:

        * aValue = 8933.234; // assignment statement
        * aValue++; // increment statement
        * System.out.println("Hello World!"); // method invocation statement
        * Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle(); // object creation statement
