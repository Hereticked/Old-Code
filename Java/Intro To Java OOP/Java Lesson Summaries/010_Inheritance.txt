    Question 1: Consider the following two classes:

        public class ClassA {
            public void methodOne(int i) {
            }
            public void methodTwo(int i) {
            }
            public static void methodThree(int i) {
            }
            public static void methodFour(int i) {
            }
        }

        public class ClassB extends ClassA {
            public static void methodOne(int i) {
            }
            public void methodTwo(int i) {
            }
            public void methodThree(int i) {
            }
            public static void methodFour(int i) {
            }
        }

        Question 1a: Which method overrides a method in the superclass?
        Answer 1a: methodTwo

        Question 1b: Which method hides a method in the superclass?
        Answer 1b: methodFour

        Question 1c: What do the other methods do?
        Answer 1c: They cause compile-time errors. 

    Question 2: Consider the Card, Deck, and DisplayDeck classes you wrote in the previous exercise. What Object methods should each of these classes override?
    Answer 2: Card and Deck should override equals, hashCode, and toString.
