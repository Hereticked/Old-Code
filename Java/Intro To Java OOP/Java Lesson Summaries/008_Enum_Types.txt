   1. Rewrite the class Card from the exercise in Questions and Exercises: Classes so that it represents the rank and suit of a card with enum types.


public enum Rank { 
   DEUCE, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN,
   EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE 
}


public enum Suit { 
   DIAMONDS, 
   CLUBS, 
   HEARTS, 
   SPADES 
}


public class Card3 {
    private final Rank rank;
    private final Suit suit;

    public Card3(Rank rank, Suit suit) {
        this.rank = rank;
        this.suit = suit;
    }

    public Suit getSuit() {
        return suit;
    }

    public Rank getRank() {
        return rank;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return rank + " of " + suit;
    }
}



   2. Rewrite the Deck class.


public class Deck3 {
    private static Card3[] cards = new Card3[52];
    public Deck3() {
        int i = 0;
        for (Suit suit : Suit.values()) {
            for (Rank rank : Rank.values()) {
                cards[i++] = new Card3(rank, suit);
            }
        }
    }
}
